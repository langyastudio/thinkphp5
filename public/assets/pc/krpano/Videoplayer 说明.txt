[videourl]
MPEG4 / H264 (.mp4, .m4v, .mov) - Flashplayer / Firefox (Windows 7+) / Safari / Chrome / IE / iOS / Android

RTMP Video Streaming (rtmp:// urls) - Flashplayer only
HTTP Live Streaming (.m3u, .m3u8) - iOS, Mac Safari only - and only for <layer> usage, not for pano videos - because of this iOS bug!

WebM (.webm) - Firefox / Chrome
Ogg Theora (.ogg, .ogv) - Firefox / Chrome
Flash Video (.flv, .f4v) - Flashplayer only

To provide several video formats and let the plugin automatically choose the appropriate one, set the paths to all video files at once and separate them by a pipe | character. videourl="video.mp4|video.webm".

Once the video is loaded, the value of the videourl attribute will be replaced by the url of the video file that was loaded.

HTML5 mobile notes - the MP4 format itself is supported by the most mobile devices, but the MP4-profile-level support can be depending on the device and its OS version.

iPhone notes (before iOS 10) - for getting sound for videos on the iPhone add an additional .m4a (HE-AAC) or .mp3 sound file to the list of available file formats. 
Example: videourl="video.mp4|video.webm|video-iphone-audio.m4a"
iPhone with iOS 10 - with iOS 10 this is not necessary anymore, iOS 10 supports inline videos on the iPhone directly. No need for an additional sound file.

[posterurl]  (HTML5 only)
The poster image needs to have the same pixel-size as the video itself!

[panovideo] (HTML5 only)
Should the video be used as panoramic video?
This settings prepares the video for a 'later' (e.g. in an other scene) usage as pano video.
Without that setting the video would become visible as normal 2d layer/plugin element until the video will be used as pano.

[iphoneworkarounds] (HTML5 only)
Enable workarounds for iPhone video support (for iOS versions before iOS 10).
Normally videos on the iPhone will be always played fullscreen in the iOS internal videoplayer, but this hack allows 'inline'-usage as part of the layout or as pano-video.
For sound support in this case, a separate .m4a (HE-AAC) or .mp3 sound file need to be provided in the videourl setting.

[touchworkarounds](HTML5 only)
Enable autoplay by touch workarounds for mobile and tablet devices.
Normally videos on mobile or tablet devices can't start playing without user interaction, but with that workaround, the krpano videoplayer plugin will automatically take the first touch anywhere on the screen to start the video.
